# Spotting-Spammer-Using-Group-Spammer-Behaviour-Analysis
K-Cliques Clustering Model to predict group spam reviews over the internet. We used the data-set from yelp.com for the results and calculations.
We made our own clustering model in order to find suspicious reviewers working in a group over the internet.
The unsupervised learning model makes a k-clique of the reviewers find suspicious reviewers group and then finds it's behavioural features.
The model has used 8 behavioural features;
    i.  Average Rating Deviation (AVG)
   ii.  Group Deviation (GD)
  iii.  Review Burst Ratio (BS)
   iv.  Group Size (GS)
    v.  Group Size Ratio (GSR)
   vi.  Review Tightness (RT)
  vii.  Group Support Count
 viii.  Group Content Similarity (GCS)
